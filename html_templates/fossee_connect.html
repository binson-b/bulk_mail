<!-- Greetings from the FOSSEE team, IIT Bombay!!!

We invite the faculty of your institute to participate in an interactive online session highlighting the use of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) in education. As you may be aware, the Government of India has been highly recommending the use of Open Source Software technologies in the e-Governance domain and education sector within the country. 

The FOSSEE (Free and Open Source Software in Education) project focuses on training students as well as teachers to use FOSS and also work towards development and promotion of Open Source Software for academia. FOSSEE promotes different FOSS packages as listed here. This is done through many activities such as workshops, conferences, internships, lab migrations, textbook companions and many other such projects. Please check our website (http://fossee.in/) for more details.

We will be glad to interact with the faculty of your institute to explain more about the projects and how they may benefit you as an institute. To conduct this session, we would require at least 5 faculty members from at least 2 departments. If you wish to participate in this online interaction, please fill this form. 

Regards,
FOSSEE Team,
IIT Bombay.
